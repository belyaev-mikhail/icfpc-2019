# The idea

We have a ton of different bots doing different things, but the birdeye view of our solution is as follows.

- Divide the whole map into fixed-size blobs, turn them into a reachability graph
- Build a suboptimal loop path through the graph (using Christofides algorithm)
- Clone as much as we can
- Divide the loop into segments for the number of bots and cover them in order
- In each segment, each bot tries to cover the area using simple (and stupid) A-star-based approach, variations may apply

For the money-spending, we are not very careful money-wise, 'cause the only thing we do is buying a friend for our lonely worker if we can.
We only do this for maps where he cannot make friends by himself.
Basically, we spend all our money for our guy not feeling lonely.

The map generator works as all other map generators do, a-staring the obstacle points to the outer area and then adding corners until we fit into the task restrictions.

# Building the solution
